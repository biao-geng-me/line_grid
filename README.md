# line_grid
Generate grid points coordinates along a line

# Usage

The main function is the `line_grid.m`, which calls the `segment_grid.m` to do the actual seeding. Generally, you divide the line into a few segments, choose the seeding type and provide the corresponding parameters for each type. No further explanation is provided here, please check the code.

The `gen_xgrid.m` and `gen_ygrid.m` are two example driver scripts. The `gen_ygrid.m` is for symmetric grids.
